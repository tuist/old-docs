description: 'Use tuist cloud organization update member to update a current member of your organization.'
---

`tuist cloud organization update` allows you to update members of your organization. Currently, that means updating their role. Members of the organization can either be `admin` or `user`. Admins have higher privileges than users â€“ they can invite new members, remove projects in an organization, etc. Users have a more passive access to Tuist Cloud features.

For example, to change an organization member's role to `admin`, run:
```sh
tuist cloud organization update member member-username --role admin
```
